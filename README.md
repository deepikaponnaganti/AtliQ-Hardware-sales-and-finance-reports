# AtliQ-Hardware-sales-and-finance-reports
In this project, I created a sales report using Excel that helps businesses figure out the best discounts, negotiate better, and spot opportunities in new markets. The reports go beyond just numbersâ€”they give practical advice on how to boost sales, make customers happier, and rake in more money.

I also added a finance report that breaks down profits and losses month by month. This part helps businesses make smart money decisions.

I had to learn a bunch of things, like using pivot tables, Power Query, and a bit of finance math. The goal is to give businesses the tools to understand and improve their sales game and make savvy financial choices.

Pivot Table Mastery:  
Efficiently manipulate and analyze data using Excel pivot tables.
