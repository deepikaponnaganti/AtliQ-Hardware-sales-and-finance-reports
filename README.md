# AtliQ-Hardware-sales-and-finance-reports
In this project, I created a sales report using Excel that helps businesses figure out the best discounts, negotiate better, and spot opportunities in new markets. The reports go beyond just numbersâ€”they give practical advice on how to boost sales, make customers happier, and rake in more money.

I also added a finance report that breaks down profits and losses month by month. This part helps businesses make smart money decisions.

I had to learn a bunch of things, like using pivot tables, Power Query, and a bit of finance math. The goal is to give businesses the tools to understand and improve their sales game and make savvy financial choices.

**Learnings:**  
Pivot Table Mastery:  
Efficiently manipulate and analyze data using Excel pivot tables.  
Power Query Expertise:  
Navigate and shape data seamlessly with Power Query for improved data processing.  
DAX (Basics) Proficiency:  
Grasp the basics of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for advanced analytics in Excel.  
Conditional Formatting Skills:  
Apply conditional formatting to highlight key insights and enhance data visualization.  
Report Beautification Techniques:

Sales Domain Metrics Understanding:    
Comprehend and utilize metrics specific to the sales domain for informed decision-making.

In summary, this project equips businesses with the tools to boost sales and manage finances effectively. By analyzing sales data and financial insights, it opens doors to new opportunities, fuels growth, and ensures competitiveness in a dynamic market.
